My absolute favorate film so far in 2013/2014 is 12 Years a Slave. 
The story is heartbreaking and brutally honest and the leading actor's performance is outstanding. 
The film is a powerful potrayal of slavery that is told bluntly and without shielding audience. 
No matter how difficult, it is a must-see film.

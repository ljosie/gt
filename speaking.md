## Describe someone that you used to meet everyday for a time who is not around you now?

## Answer:
This  question reminds me of the girt who would always attend Langlib lectures with me in college, Jessie.

Jessie is a typical girl next-door. And her eyes are so shiny that when you look at her eyes, you feel the stars are no longer there.
She has really beautiful long hair and it always fall down on her shoulders in perfection. But she became really humble and honest whrn she doubted in her arreactiveness.

I used to see her all the time, but now she's already in America studying in Minisoda University. If I ever had the chance to see her again,I would say to her face how I trully feel about her.

I would tell her how beautiful she looks and how her smile make the world, my world stop, and how I would stare at her a while.

Don't ever change, because she's amazing just the way she is.
